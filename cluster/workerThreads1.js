/**
 * The worker_threads module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript in parallel.
 * Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations. 
 * They will not help much with I/O-intensive work. 
 * Node.jsâ€™s built-in asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.
 * Unlike child_process or cluster, worker_threads can share memory. 
 * They do so by transferring ArrayBuffer instances or sharing SharedArrayBuffer instances.
